## How we built it

### Architecture Overview
```
PDF Upload ‚Üí OCR Processing ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Web Dashboard
     ‚Üì            ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì
   Flask      Google Vision   Gemini AI   Matplotlib
```

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Modern responsive design with dark/light theme support
- **Chart.js Integration**: Interactive visualizations via Matplotlib-generated charts
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes

#### Backend  
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework handling routes and sessions
- **Flask-Session**: Filesystem-based session management for large data persistence
- **PyMuPDF**: PDF-to-image conversion for OCR preprocessing

#### AI & OCR Services
- **Google Cloud Vision**: High-accuracy OCR text extraction from PDF images
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Advanced language model for:
  - Structured data extraction (FAQs, schedules)  
  - Natural language Q&A responses
  - Content summarization

#### Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib**: Generates assignment distribution and cumulative grade charts
- **Dynamic PNG Generation**: Real-time chart creation with proper scaling

### Key Features
- **Graceful Degradation**: Mock mode available when API keys aren't configured
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for all external services  
- **Session Management**: Large text data stored in temporary files vs. cookies
- **Security**: Proper CORS handling, file size limits, and input validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes* | Your Google Gemini API key for AI processing |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Yes* | Path to Google Cloud service account JSON |
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | No | Custom secret key (auto-generated if not set) |
| `PORT` | No | Port number (default: 8080) |
| `USE_MOCK` | No | Set to "1" to enable mock mode without API calls |

*Not required when `USE_MOCK=1`

### Mock Mode
For development or testing without API keys:
```bash
export USE_MOCK=1
python app.py
```

Mock mode provides realistic sample data to test the interface without external API calls.

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t syllascan .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key" \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/app/credentials.json" \
  -v /path/to/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json \
  syllascan
```

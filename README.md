## ✨ Inspiration

I just like building stuff I'd actually use. As a 🎓 student, I don't know how many times I've woken up at night 😵 forgetting a paper.
Not saying this is going to entirely solve that problem but...

## ⚡ What it does

I do believe that this site makes it easier to quickly answer all common questions ❓ in a fraction of the time ⏱️.

## 🛠️ How we built it

The stack is as follows:

🐍 Flask → full stack web-server for HTML/CSS 🎨 and client ↔️ server communication

## 👁️ Google Vision → OCR

💡 Gemini 2.5 Flash → Summarization into easy snippets

📊 Matplotlib → Graphing

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

Navigating Google Cloud Console ☁️ for IAM roles was a bit tricky 🧩

Took ~30 minutes ⏳ to get the application credentials running

## 🏆 Accomplishments we're proud of

Built the application faster ⚡ than anything I’ve done before

A very simple idea 💡 that came to life within just a few hours 🚀

## 📚 What we learned

Knowing what you want 🎯 makes everything super simple ✅

## 🔮 What's next for SyllaScan

📅 Add a full-fledged calendar for managing assignments

🚀 Switch to Groq API (it’s faster!)

💸 Make it good enough for people to justify a subscription

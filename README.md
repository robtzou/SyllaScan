# SyllaScan

✨ Inspiration

I just like building stuff I'd actually use. As a 🎓 student, I don't know how many times I've woken up at night 😵 forgetting a paper. Not saying this is going to entirely solve that problem but..

⚡ What it does

I do believe that this site makes it easier to quickly answer all common questions ❓ in a fraction of the time ⏱️.

🛠️ How we built it

The stack is as follows:

Flask 🐍 acts as a full stack web-server displaying both the HTML/CSS 🎨 as well as passing credentials between client-side ↔️ server-side applications.

Google Vision 👁️ is used for OCR.

Gemini 2.5 Flash 💡 for summarizing content into easy snippets.

Matplotlib 📊 for graphing.

🚧 Challenges we ran into

Navigating Google Cloud Console ☁️ for IAM administration roles can be a bit tricky 🧩, but it only took around 30 minutes ⏳ to get the application credentials running.

🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

I haven't built an application this fast ⚡ in my entire life. I know it's a very simple idea 💡 but it came to life within just a short few hours ⏱️.

📚 What we learned

Knowing what you want 🎯 makes everything super simple.

🔮 What's next for SyllaScan

For it to be a profitable 💸 application, it would have to be good enough for people to justify a subscription 💳.

Features like a full-fledged calendar 📅 to manage assignments would be the goal.

Also switch to Groq API 🚀 — it's faster!
